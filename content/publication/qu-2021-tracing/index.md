abstract: 'As a huge variety of information floods pouring over us each day, identifying the authenticity of massive events becomes a necessary task to maintain the stability of Mobile Social Networks (MSNs). With this regard, this paper proposes a diffusion model that characterizes the simultaneous diffusion of both truth and rumor in realistic MSNs, and makes the first attempt to figure out their respective sources. The problem of interest can be stated as: Given an outcome of cascade of both truth and rumor in MSNs, i.e., a set of nodes that might be the ignorant, the spreader of truth or rumor, or simply the silent receiver, how can we infer both truth sources and rumor sources Different from previous sources detection works considering single type of nodes, the interplay between truth diffusions and rumor diffusions makes the conventional methods not work. To answer this question, we aim to maximize the similarity index, i.e., the number of nodes possessing the same states between the resulting network triggered by our estimated sources with the proposed diffusion model and the given observation network.i much harder to find two kinds of sets at the same time, including truth sources and rumor sources'
