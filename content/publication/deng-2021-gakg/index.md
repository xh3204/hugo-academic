abstract: 'The research of geoscience plays a strong role in helping people gain a better understanding of the Earth. To effectively represent the knowledge (KG) from enormous geoscience research papers, knowledge graphs can be a powerful means. In the face of enormous geoscience research papers, knowledge graphs can be a powerful means to manage the relationships of data and integrate knowledge extracted from them. However, the existing geoscience KGs mainly focus on the external connection between concepts, whereas the potential abundant information contained in the internal multimodal data of the paper is largely overlooked for more fine-grained knowledge mining. To this end, we propose GAKG, a large-scale multimodal academic KG based on 1.12 million papers published in various geoscience-related journals. In addition to the bibliometrics elements, we also extracted the internal illustrations, tables, and text information of the articles, and dig out the knowledge entities of the papers and the era and spatial attributes of the articles, coupling multimodal academic data and features. Specifically, GAKG realizes knowledge entity extraction under our proposed Human-In-the-Loop framework, the novelty of which is to combine the techniques of machine reading and information retrieval with manual annotation of geoscientists in the loop. Considering the fact that literature of geoscience often contains more abundant illustrations and time scale information compared with that of other disciplines, we extract all the geographical information and era from the geoscience papers' text and illustrations, mapping papers to the atlas and chronology. Based on GAKG, we build several knowledge discovery benchmarks for finding geoscience communities and predicting potential links. GAKG and its services have been made publicly available and user-friendly.'
